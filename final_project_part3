The focus of my project was to share some of the year to date impact of POISE Foundation's Critical Community Needs Fund on Black communities and families in the Pittsburgh Region.
I planned to analyze the data that POISE was able to collect via our Critical Community Needs grant application and the first wave of grant reports from grantees.
My goal was to tell the story of impact from the perspective of a typical Black family that our grantees would serve.  My target audience is the following:

1. POISE Board Members and Staff
2. The Philanthropic Community at large
3. Donors
4. The Community at large

I began by thinking about the type of data that I wanted to share to build the story. I eventually landed on starting with data on how the Black community has been
disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. I used national data that I found via the following sources:

* "The Color of Coronavirus: COVID-19 Deaths by Race and Ethnicity in the U.S.," APM Research Lab, https://www.apmresearchlab.org/covid/deaths-by-race#counts
    * [AMP Reserach Lab](https://www.apmresearchlab.org/covid/deaths-by-race#counts)
* Inequality.Org - https://inequality.org/facts/racial-inequality/#racial-inequality-covid
    * [Inequality.org](https://inequality.org/facts/racial-inequality/#racial-inequality-covid)

Then I wanted to incorporate county data.  I found it challenging finding data on the Black population in Beaver County as it relates to COVID-19 cases.
The Allegheny County Health Department was lobbied and pressured into collecting data by race and neighborhood because of the national 
disproportionate impact. So, I focused only on using population and case data for Allegheny County on that I found on the following sites:

* Allegheny County Site - https://www.alleghenycounty.us/Health-Department/Resources/COVID-19/COVID-19.aspx 
    * [Allegheny County Data](https://www.alleghenycounty.us/Health-Department/Resources/COVID-19/COVID-19.aspx)
* Census Quick Facts - https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/alleghenycountypennsylvania
    * [Allegheny County Census Data](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/alleghenycountypennsylvania)

Once I decided on my national and county data, I proceeded to analyze the data collected from the CCNF applications and reports. I ran a series of 
reports from our grants management system.  The data from the reports was downloaded into csv tables that I began to analyze further and breakdown in excel.
Once my data tables were ready, I began to select the visuals that I thought would best highlight the data. I used a combination of Infogram and Flourish to construct
my visuals.  All of the images of the virus and the family was purchased from Shutterstock.

After the visuals were constructed, I worked began to work on the Tyson family narrative. I had a starting point from my wireframe in Part 2.
I received great feedback about using a family to highlight the story. Interviewees wanted more connections between the Tysons and the Critical
Community Needs Fund. They also wanted some closure.  So, the narrative was built to add those connections and even though there is closure, there is also uncertainty
due to the pandemic.
