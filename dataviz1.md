### **Explanation**
The method used in the bar chart allows one to see simply who has the highest Debt to GDP ratio among the GDP countries and who has the lowest. 
You can hover over the graphs to learn exact numbers over the years and amounts. 
But, overall the first graph gives the audience a picture of smallest to largest Debt to GDP ratio.
The second visual used individual line charts to show the changes in the Debt to GDP ratio for in each G20 country from 1995-2019.
The audience can see increases and decreases over the years in the Debt to GDP ration for each country.
One can make some generalizations about which country has increasing debt, which country is lowering their debt, and which countries have pretty steady debt during the time alloted time frame.
The final visual used a linear scatter plot. This allows the audience to see where a country's debt has been clustered.
When you hover over a section of dots you can see the specific years and amounts.
For example, you can see that the Mexico's Debt to GDP ratios are clustered on the lower end in the 30s.
Yet, in Japan - a large cluster of their Debt to GDP ratiso tends to be greater than 230.
