This chart was re-created from the data within a report generated by the Budget and Legislative Analyst Office of the city and county of San Francisco.
The report focused on the *Comparative Street Cleaning Costs: San Francisco and 11 Other Cities*.
Sixteen comparable cities were surveyed but only 11 responded to the survey.
