This chart was re-created from the data within a report generated by the Budget and Legislative Analyst Office of the city and county of San Francisco.
The report focused on the *Comparative Street Cleaning Costs: San Francisco and 11 Other Cities*.
Sixteen comparable cities were surveyed but only 11 responded to the survey.
In doing this chart, Tabula was super helpful and easy to use when converting the chart in the PDF to data.
I was not able to copy and past the information into Google Sheets for some reason.
So, I simply downloaded the CSV file and copied and pasted the data from there.
I found this difficult to manage when it came to trying to adjust the the dat range on the y-axis.
I want $45 and not $50 to be my max but the graph just kept messing up no matter what I did to make the change.
Overall the use of Tabula was the best part of this activity.
