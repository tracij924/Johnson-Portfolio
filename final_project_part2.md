### Target Audience

For my target audience, my aim is to reach the public at large as well as the philanthropic community as well.
My story hopes to inform the public and the philanthropic community about the following:
1. COVID-19 disparities in the Black community.
2. The Critical Community Needs Fund estabblished by POISE Foundation as a way of mitigating those disparities.
3. How a family in the Black community has benefited from the Critical Community Needs Fund grants to organizations.
4. How they can support Black families through the Critical Community Needs Fund.


### Interviewees

I wanted to interview people from the the philanthropic community and the public at larger.  I wanted to obtain input from thos familiar with POISE and the Critical Community Needs Fund and those maybe not so familar.  I also wanted to see if the public was aware of philanthropic investments in the Black community to mitigate disparities from COVID-19. I was able to interview five individuals from the following groups:
1. Philanthropy
2. Public at-Large
3. Black Community Member

### Scripts

For my script I asked the following questions:

1. Are you aware of any COVID-19 philanthropic investments in the Black communities of Allegheny and Beaver Counties?
2. How is the flow of the Shorthand platform? Does the flow make sense?
3. What gaps are still missing? Is there any part that is confusing?
4. What other questions or thoughts come to mind?
5. Would you be compelled to support this fund?

I was able to email these questions to individuals for feedback and I had follow-up conversations with some to gain clarity as needed.
