# **About Me**

<img src="./IMG_0953(1).png>

My name is Traci. I am currently a part-time Masters in Public Management student at CMUs Heinz College.
When I'm not working on MPM classes, I work full-time as a Program Officer at POISE Foundation.  POISE is a Black-led, Black serving community foundation in Pennsylvania.
As a Program Officer, I manage the Foundation's grantmaking processes, procedures, IRS compliance and database.
I am also responsible for developing POISE's grantmaking strategies for new and existing funds.
And finally, I lead many of the Foundation's strategice initiatives such as Strengthening Black Families.

Data plays an important role in all of my work from our community investments to the type of organizations that we serve through our grantmaking.
In my work I am interested in our impact as a Foundation. Data also tells me how to shape our various grantmaking strategies. When I graduate from Heinz, I am hoping that I can continue in philanthropy. My aim is to one day lead as foundation as the CEO.
