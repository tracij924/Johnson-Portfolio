# **Johnson-Portfolio**

This is my *Online Portfolio* for the Telling Stories with Data class at Heinz College.


# **About Me**

![Traci](https://github.com/tracij924/Johnson-Portfolio/blob/main/IMG_0953%20(1).jpg)
          

My name is Traci. I am currently a part-time Masters in Public Management student at CMUs Heinz College.
When I'm not working on MPM classes, I work full-time as a Program Officer at POISE Foundation.  POISE is a Black-led, Black serving community foundation in Pennsylvania.
As a Program Officer, I manage the Foundation's grantmaking processes, procedures, IRS compliance and database.
I am also responsible for developing POISE's grantmaking strategies for new and existing funds.
And finally, I lead many of the Foundation's strategice initiatives such as Strengthening Black Families.

Data plays an important role in all of my work from our community investments to the type of organizations that we serve through our grantmaking.
In my work I am interested in our impact as a Foundation. Data also tells me how to shape our various grantmaking strategies. When I graduate from Heinz, I am hoping that I can continue in philanthropy. My aim is to one day lead as foundation as the CEO.


# **What I Hope To Learn**

As mentioned in the *About Me* section, data is crucial to my work. 
I have learned that data is crucial to sharing impact for nonprofit organizations and philanthropy is no different.
By taking this class, I hope to learn creative ways to use data to tell our story of impact.
We collect data about our organizations across our various grants.
I want to be able to see and share how our grantmaking is making an impact in the communities that we serve.
I also would like to be able to share the gaps in our work through data.
I can do simple bar and pie charts.
But, I would like to be able to do sophisticated presentations like I the first day of class.  That is what I want to learn and apply.
