# **POISE Foundation Critical Community Needs Fund**

##**Summary**

I am a Program Officer at POISE Foundation. POISE is a Black-led, Black serving community foundation.
When the COVID-19 Pandemic began to disproportionately impact Black-led, Black serving nonprofits and churches, the Foundation immediately took action to assess the needs of the community and the organizations that serve them.
Through a survey and a focus groups with organization leaders, we found the Black-led, Black serving organizations were pivoting their services to meet community needs. And, they were also financially vulnerable due to the shut-down.
POISE was able to use this data to create and fundraise for a new fund, the Critical Community Needs Fund (CCNF).
CCNF provides COVID-19 emergency grants up to $25,000 for small to medium-sized Black-led, Black serving organizations, churches, and mosques.
Organizations must have a budget of $600,000 or less and 10 or less employees.  As the program officer that designed this grant strategy, i want to take a dive into the data that we have collected to tell the story of CCNF and our impact to date.
