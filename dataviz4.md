# **Assignment 4 - Grant Distribution Data**

I selected data that could be found on the Foundation Center website. This chart was created as a visual for some data mapping
done at the Foundation Center now known as Candid.  Foundations are able to voluntarily submit data on their grantmaking and Candid maps the data.
The data is freely accessible along with the charts. But you can not download it.  The chart that I set out to recreate is grant distribution
data for Early Childhood Education in the United States.

Here is a link to the data:
[Data Visualization](https://maps.foundationcenter.org/#/charts/?subjects=all&popgroups=all&years=all&location=6252001&excludeLocation=0&geoScale=ADM1&layer=recip&boundingBox=-157.060546875,18.729501999072138,-47.02148437499999,58.12431960569374&gmOrgs=all&recipOrgs=all&tags=all&keywords=&pathwaysOrg=&pathwaysType=&acct=earlychildren&typesOfSupport=all&transactionTypes=all&amtRanges=all&minGrantAmt=0&maxGrantAmt=0&gmTypes=all&minAssetsAmt=0&maxAssetsAmt=0&minGivingAmt=0&maxGivingAmt=0&andOr=0&includeGov=1&custom=all&customArea=all&indicator=&dataSource=oecd&chartType=bars&multiSubject=1&listType=gm&windRoseAnd=undefined&zoom=4)


I found the visualization to be basic but not intuitive at first glance.  This tool is used by grant seekers and grantmakers.
It was not clear what story Candid was trying to tell with this data.  The title also didn't bring clarity to the story as well.
I found myself questioning if Candid was making a comparison between states and if so how. I also wondered about the significance
of the Total Number Of Grants.  I also began to question that with an invesment of $9.6 billion why did that amoun to less than
200,000 grants given.  So I decided to use a portion of this data and this visualization to tell a story about investment not keeping pace with grants given by state.


I first started by wanting to make changes to the visualiation and the amount of data used.  I liked the use of black and gray as colors.  I also liked that the data was labeled. I liked the use of the bar chart but I don't like how the bars are going in the same direction. I would opt to pair them if possible going in the same direction or I would have them going in opposite directions and give color to the bars that I wanted to use as the center of my story. I would also change the title for clarity.

So I started with this basic wire frame:

This was my rough sketch and basic idea. I kept the bar chart and I started with all of the bars going in the same direction.

I then moved to some detailed draft sketches for to get feedback from peers.
